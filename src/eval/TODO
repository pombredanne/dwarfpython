FIXME: move all the evaluate() functions out of the ast/*.cc files and into their own cc 
files here. This is a good idea not only because parsing and evaluating are different 
things, but because the ast/*.cc files get read by the autogen.py so are subject to layout 
constraints, which may become a pain once evaluate() code gets hairy.
